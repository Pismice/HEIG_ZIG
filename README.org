* Zig Documentation
The purpose of this repository is to document the features of the Zig language, as well as examples of its use.

You can use this documentation with 2 different ways:
- Using emacs org mode so that you can execute codes on the fly(litterate programming)
- Opening the index.html file in your browser or navigating to our [[hosted guide][https://pismice.github.io/HEIG_ZIG/]] 

** Remarks
- We are going to move all the "Sources" to the "Bilbliography" chapter using Zotero
- Some exemples are not working with emacs yet
- You might see a few TODO or empty chapters, those are the ones we are working on or plan to work on in the future
