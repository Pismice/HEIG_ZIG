Using ZIG before 1.0 might require that you ofter switch between master and the last official release.

One solution would be to install both (or more) versions of ZIG and switch the PATH environment variable to the version you want to use.

But the best solution is to use the ZIG version manager, which is a tool that allows you to install and switch between different versions of ZIG.

We recommend using ZVM (Zig Version Manager ^^) which is a simple and easy to use tool. (https://github.com/tristanisham/zvm)
