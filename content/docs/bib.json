To simultaneously enforce memory safety and prevent data races, its \"borrow checker\" tracks the object lifetime of all references in a program during compilation.\nRust was influenced by ideas from functional programming, including immutability, higher-order functions, and algebraic data types. It is popular for systems programming.\nSoftware developer Graydon Hoare created Rust as a personal project while working at Mozilla Research in 2006. Mozilla officially sponsored the project in 2009. In the years following the first stable release in May 2015, Rust was adopted by companies including Amazon, Discord, Dropbox, Google (Alphabet), Meta, and Microsoft. In December 2022, it became the first language other than C and assembly to be supported in the development of the Linux kernel.\nRust has been noted for its rapid adoption, and has been studied in programming language theory research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,14]]},"citation-key":"RustProgrammingLanguage2024","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,7]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1222651364","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Rust (programming language)","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rust_(programming_language)&oldid=1222651364"},

  {"id":"StreamingSIMDExtensions2023","abstract":"In computing, Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) is a single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) instruction set extension to the x86 architecture, designed by Intel and introduced in 1999 in their Pentium III series of central processing units (CPUs) shortly after the appearance of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD's) 3DNow!. SSE contains 70 new instructions (65 unique mnemonics using 70 encodings), most of which work on single precision floating-point data. SIMD instructions can greatly increase performance when exactly the same operations are to be performed on multiple data objects. Typical applications are digital signal processing and graphics processing.\nIntel's first IA-32 SIMD effort was the MMX instruction set. MMX had two main problems: it re-used existing x87 floating-point registers making the CPUs unable to work on both floating-point and SIMD data at the same time, and it only worked on integers. SSE floating-point instructions operate on a new independent register set, the XMM registers, and adds a few integer instructions that work on MMX registers.\nSSE was subsequently expanded by Intel to SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3 and SSE4. Because it supports floating-point math, it had wider applications than MMX and became more popular. The addition of integer support in SSE2 made MMX largely redundant, though further performance increases can be attained in some situations by using MMX in parallel with SSE operations.\nSSE was originally called Katmai New Instructions (KNI), Katmai being the code name for the first Pentium III core revision. During the Katmai project Intel sought to distinguish it from their earlier product line, particularly their flagship Pentium II. It was later renamed Internet Streaming SIMD Extensions (ISSE), then SSE. AMD eventually added support for SSE instructions, starting with its Athlon XP and Duron (Morgan core) processors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,14]]},"citation-key":"StreamingSIMDExtensions2023","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,7]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1179009683","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Streaming SIMD Extensions","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Streaming_SIMD_Extensions&oldid=1179009683"},
