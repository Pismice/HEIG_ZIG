*** HTTP from the std
**** Description
TODO: This section is completly work in progress
from discord creator of zap: To put it simply: std.http has no concept of multiple concurrent connections. So you have to write your own "framework" handling that, e.g. using a thread-pool for handling requests and implementing some sort of polling to know when there's activity on the connections, and combine the two (poll & pool).

std.http is very useful for what it was designed for. The Client was added to fetch packages, the Server to test the client. It's not designed to be a 100% out-of-the-box integratable implementation of everything HTTP/web, nor is it meant to be used in production in a massively multithreaded setup.
